# equalstreetnames-berlin

This repository keeps the configuration to build your own equalstreetnames-berlin, which is based on [equalstreetnames](https://github.com/openknowledgebe/equalstreetnames).

See it online at [https://umap.openstreetmap.de/equalstreetnames-berlin](https://umap.openstreetmap.de/equalstreetnames-berlin)

The map shows OpenStreetMap ways of type "highway", "place" and "leisure" and relations of type "associatedStreet" (which is unwanted in Germany but still there) and "street". See [overpass querys](https://github.com/gislars/equalstreetnames-berlin/blob/master/overpass/way-full-json) for details.

You can contribute to OpenStreetMap by adding the tag name:etymology:wikidata=<wikidata id> see this [example](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/10737255).
